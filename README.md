### Why did you make it?
- xlnt is a excellent library for usinf xlsx Excel files. :+1: 
- I was looking for a way to make it easy to use in Qt. Of course, cmake is compatible with Qt, but it is not convenient to use. So I created Qxlnt.

	- gcc 4.x(4.8 or below) is not supported. Current(2018) gcc version is 7.x.
