## Introduction
xlnt is a modern C++ library for manipulating spreadsheets in memory and reading/writing them from/to XLSX files as described in [ECMA 376 4th edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm). The first public release of xlnt version 1.0 was on May 10th, 2017. Current work is focused on increasing compatibility, improving performance, and brainstorming future development goals. For a high-level summary of what you can do with this library, see [the feature list](https://tfussell.gitbooks.io/xlnt/content/docs/introduction/Features.html). Contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests or discussions on [the repository's Issues page](https://github.com/tfussell/xlnt/issues).

## Example

Including xlnt in your project, creating a new spreadsheet, and saving it as "example.xlsx"

```c++
#include <xlnt/xlnt.hpp>

int main()
{
    xlnt::workbook wb;
    xlnt::worksheet ws = wb.active_sheet();
    ws.cell("A1").value(5);
    ws.cell("B2").value("string data");
    ws.cell("C3").formula("=RAND()");
    ws.merge_cells("C3:C4");
    ws.freeze_panes("B2");
    wb.save("example.xlsx");
    return 0;
}
// compile with -std=c++14 -Ixlnt/include -lxlnt
```
